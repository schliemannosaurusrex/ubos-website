UBOS website
============

On-line at [ubos.net](https://ubos.net/)

* The main site is created with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Sources are in directory `jekyll`.
* The /docs subdirectory is created with [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/). Sources are in
  separate repository [ubos-docs](https://github.com/uboslinux/ubos-docs/).

Note that the Sphinx parts use the CSS generated by Jekyll.
