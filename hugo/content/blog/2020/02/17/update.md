A new UBOS update is available on all release channels and all platforms.

The focus of this release was tracking upstream package upgrades. The biggest
new feature is that UBOS now writes system logs to the UBOS Staff.
This aids in troubleshooting systems that don't have keyboards or monitors.

There is also an initial integration with the Storj decentralized storage network
on the "yellow" release channel, and the usual bug fixes and documentation improvements.

As usual, the details are in the
[release notes](/docs/releases/2020-02-17/release-notes/).
