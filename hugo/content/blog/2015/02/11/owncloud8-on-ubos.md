Our friends at
<a href="https://owncloud.com/self-hosted-owncloud-server-8-offers-faster-easier-file-sync-share-federated-cloud-sharing/">ownCloud</a>
released their version 8 the day before we pushed out
UBOS beta 2. We managed to include it at the last minute, and here is a video
that shows how easy it is to install ownCloud on UBOS.

virtual host setup, SSL/TLS setup, and using Bonjour/mDNS, it only takes a single command
and about a minute!
