* <b>UBOSBox Nextcloud</b> is a hardware appliance which pre-installs UBOS, and auto-installs
  <a href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud</a>, the open-source file management and
  collaboration app. UBOSBox Nextcloud allows non-technical users to "bring their data home"
  from the file sharing services such as Dropbox, or on-line calendars like Google Calendar,
  to hardware the user has full control over in their home, without needing to deal with
  software installation or configuration. It is designed to be used without needing a
  monitor or keyboard.

  UBOSBox Nextcloud comes in three configurations:
  <a href="https://indiecomputing.com/products/ubosbox-nextcloud-on-nuc/">UBOSbox Nextcloud
  on NUC (model A)</a> is based on the Intel NUC mini-PC with a low-power Celeron processor.
  <a href="https://indiecomputing.com/products/ubosbox-nextcloud-on-nuc/">UBOSbox Nextcloud
  on NUC (model B)</a> packs about twice the punch with twice the memory and
  disk, and an i5 processor.
  <a href="https://indiecomputing.com/products/ubosbox-nextcloud-on-raspberrypi/">UBOSbox
  Nextcloud on Raspberry Pi</a> is a lower-price option that comes as a kit that requires
  hardware assembly by the user. Software is pre-installed on all configurations.

* <a href="https://indiecomputing.com/products/ubos-live/"><b>UBOS Live</b></a> is a new
  management service for devices running UBOS. This enables users to outsource ongoing
  management and systems administration of the home servers running UBOS to Indie Computing.
  Indie Computing will upgrade and patch the installed operating systems and installed apps
  on an ongoing basis over the network, monitor hardware for potential failures, and, if
  needed, perform any necessary other maintenance tasks.

UBOSBox Nextcloud is available for immediate order at
<a href="https://indiecomputing.com/">indiecomputing.com</a>, with delivery starting
in September.
