This update has new packages both on the UBOS operating system level, and for applications.
Sometimes, we have to do both at the same time!

As indicated in the last update, This is also the first update in which we use a new numbering
scheme based on the date of the announcement.

For now, updates have been published to the `yellow` channel only. We will promote it
to `green` in a few days, assuming things go well. If you like to be notified when UBOS
updates have been published, or for any other notifications, here is the first news for you:

## Release notification mailing lists

* We have created notification-only mailing lists (separate for the `yellow` and the
  `green` channel) that you can subscribe to, to be notified when there are updates
  on the respective channel.
