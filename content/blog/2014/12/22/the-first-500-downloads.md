I'm happy to announce that as of today, UBOS has been successfully downloaded more than five hundred times!

Trying out the beta of an operating system is not for the faint of heart: you need a spare
computer to install it on, or at least be familiar with virtualization. Which means geeks
only with some time. So I'm quite impressed by 500 downloads in the short time that UBOS
has been available.

Here's the breakdown by platform:

and here by top-level domain:

A great Christmas present. Happy Holidays!!

P.S. There were many more partial downloads, which is not surprising given the size of the
image files.
