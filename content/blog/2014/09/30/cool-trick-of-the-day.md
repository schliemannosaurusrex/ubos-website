Letâ€™s say you set up a site with some apps, but at the wrong hostname. That just happened
to me. I meant to call the hostname ``selfoss-test``, but accidentally I called it
``test-selfoss``.

This is what I did to correct the situation (all on one line):

```
% sudo ubos-admin showsite --host test-selfoss --json \
    | sed -e 's/test-selfoss/selfoss-test/' \
    | sudo ubos-admin deploy --stdin
```

In English: Take the Site JSON of the site currently at hostname ``test-selfoss``,
replace ``test-selfoss`` with ``selfoss-test``, and deploy. Note that because we did not
change the site id or the appconfig ids, all the data was preserved.
