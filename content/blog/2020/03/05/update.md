A new UBOS apps update is available on all release channels and all platforms.

Nextcloud on UBOS is now the newly released
[Nextcloud Hub](https://nextcloud.com/hub/). Among its many new features:

* Collaborate on rich documents over the internet right from the browser, just
  as if it were Google Docs: documents, spreadsheets and presentation. Except,
  there's no third party cloud overlord spying on you.

* Full text search. Automatically indexes all your documents, so you can quickly
  find what you are looking for.

Many other applications were upgraded as well.

The details are in the
[release notes](/docs/releases/2020-03-05/release-notes/).
