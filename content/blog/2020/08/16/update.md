A new UBOS update is available on all release channels and all platforms.

Here are some of the highlights:

* The Raspberry Pi 4 is now supported.
* UBOS has become even smarter about dependency management: if an Accessory requires
  another, you don't need to specify the second one any more when creating or updating
  a Site. This is a great time saver when running Apps such as Wordpress or Nextcloud
  where Accessories often depend on others.
* Improvement to the HTML generated for the UBOS Staff.
* More customization options are available for Nextcloud
* Speed improvements, bug fixes and lots of little things that make day-to-day
  work with UBOS even simpler. Like ``ubos-admin listsites --with <app>``.

As usual, the details are in the
