A new UBOS update is available on all release channels and all platforms.

Here are some of the highlights:

* UBOS can now run on ODROID "home cloud" devices such as ODROID-XU4 and ODROID-HC2.
* On a Raspberry Pi 4, UBOS can now boot directly from an external USB disk.
* The UBOS installer has become smarter, and more flexible.
* Hundreds of package updates.

As usual, the details are in the
[release notes](/docs/releases/2020-09-26/release-notes/).
