Beta 9 has arrived with new software packages, new features and the obligatory
bug fixes. Here are some of the highlights:

* Nextcloud 10 is now available, as well as easy ways to upgrade from Nextcloud 9
  and from ownCloud.

* Wordpress has gained some themes and plugins to make websites prettier.

* Automatic file system snapshots protect against failing upgrades. Not that those should
  ever happen, but let's be safe instead of sorry.

* The development of UBOS-based appliances has become simpler and more secure.

* Various bug fixes and improvements.

* All images for all platforms has been updated.

These are just some of the highlights. The more detailed release notes are
~~here~~.

And as you probably know: to upgrade your device, all you need to say is
``sudo ubos-admin update``.

We'd love your {{% pageref "/community.md" feedback %}}.
