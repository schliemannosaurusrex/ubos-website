title:  Migrating this site to Hugo and Sphinx

summary: "This site has been migrated to Hugo and Sphinx, from Jekyll and Sphinx. Please bear with us."
---

This site has always been using two static site generators:

* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for the main site, and
* [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) for the technical documentation.

We recently migrated the Jekyll part to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), also a static site
generator, but one that makes our life easier. For one, we can use reusable themes and
so we can "plug in" the CSS for responsive sites that we've been using elsewhere.

As a user of this site, this should make no difference to you. Except that if we broke
something during the port (very likely!), please do let us. Thanks!!
