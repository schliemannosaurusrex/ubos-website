You can run UBOS:

<img src="/images/rpi-83x100.png"  alt="[Raspberry Pi]" style="float: right; margin: 5px 20px">

 * on standard PCs, as their primary operating system
 * on standard PCs and Macs, in VirtualBox
 * on your Raspberry Pi Model B and Model B+.

<h2>Highlights</h2>

 * Many bug fixes and reliability improvements from beta 1, as to be expected.

 * UBOS has an installer that makes it easy to install UBOS on a new
   computer. Download the the image for a bootstick, boot in the boot stick and
   run ``sudo ubos-install /dev/sda`` to install UBOS on your first hard drive. RAID1
   is also no problem, simply say ``sudo ubos-install /dev/sda /dev/sdb``. More options
   are available.

 * UBOS now makes it just as easy to create TLS-secured websites as it is to create
   non-secure ones. Just say ``sudo ubos-admin createsite --tls --selfsigned``. You can
   also bring an official certificate.

 * Hosts running UBOS now advertise themselves on the local network using mDNS/zeroconf.
   This solves the problem of "but what IP address does my box have"? Look for
   ``ubos-pc.local``, ``ubos-raspberry-pi.local`` etc. on your local network.

 * Many improvements that make packaging and testing apps for UBOS easier and more
   reliable.
