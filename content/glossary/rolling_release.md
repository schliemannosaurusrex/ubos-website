Most operating system distros release a major release every couple of years with
major new features, and then minor updates on a regular basis.

A distro using {{% gls Rolling_Release %}}, such as UBOS, provides updates on a continuous
basis without major jumps. This allows user {{% gls device %}} to be more up-to-date more
of the time, and avoids often error-prone major upgrades.
