UBOS is a Linux distro that aims to make it 10x easier to
[self-host](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting_(web_services)) popular open-source
web applications, for yourself, or for your family, on hardware or cloud servers you own.

Why give your valuable data to Google or some other data overlord, if you can keep it
under your own control? All you need is a spare (physical, virtual, or cloud) computer
that can run Linux. UBOS automates much of the administration, so you can get on with life.

Want to use Nextcloud instead of Dropbox? Shaarli instead of delicious? An RSS
reader or discussion forum? UBOS makes installation and maintenance easy and quick.
