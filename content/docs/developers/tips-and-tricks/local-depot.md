title: Using up a local Depot
---

Usually, a UBOS installation pulls software packages from the official {{% gl Depot %}}.
However, during development and testing, it may be advantageous to run a local
{{% gl Depot %}}  on a build machine.

### Setting up a Depot container

To set this up, follow these steps:

1. Go to the ``ubos-buildconfig`` directory.

1. Create an ssh keypair you will use to upload new packages to the depot, e.g.:

   ```
   % mkdir local.ssh
   % ssh-keygen
   ```

   Enter a filename such as ``local.ssh/id_rsa`` and no passphrase.

1. Create a systemd service file that will start the ``depot`` container correctly.
   Depending on your needs, you may use different values. Here is an example that
   uses the host's ``/home/buildmaster/UBOS-STAFF-DEPOT`` as the container's UBOS Staff, so
   you can log in via ssh afterwards. We save it as
   ``/etc/systemd/system/systemd-nspawn@depot.service``:

   ```
   # systemd .service file for starting a UBOS depot container, modify as needed
   # compare with /usr/lib/systemd/system/systemd-nspawn@.service

   [Unit]
   Description=Local UBOS depot
   Documentation=man:systemd-nspawn(1)
   PartOf=machines.target
   Before=machines.target
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/systemd-nspawn --quiet --keep-unit --boot \
           --link-journal=try-guest --network-veth --machine=%I \
           --bind /home/buildmaster/UBOS-STAFF-DEPOT:/UBOS-STAFF
   KillMode=mixed
   Type=notify
   RestartForceExitStatus=133
   SuccessExitStatus=133
   Slice=machine.slice
   Delegate=yes

   # Enforce a strict device policy, similar to the one nspawn configures
   # when it allocates its own scope unit. Make sure to keep these
   # policies in sync if you change them!
   DevicePolicy=strict
   DeviceAllow=/dev/null rwm
   DeviceAllow=/dev/zero rwm
   DeviceAllow=/dev/full rwm
   DeviceAllow=/dev/random rwm
   DeviceAllow=/dev/urandom rwm
   DeviceAllow=/dev/tty rwm
   DeviceAllow=/dev/net/tun rwm
   DeviceAllow=/dev/pts/ptmx rw
   DeviceAllow=char-pts rw

   [Install]
   WantedBy=machines.target
   ```

1. Make sure the ``/home/buildmaster/UBOS-STAFF-DEPOT`` directory exists (if you chose the
   above configuration) and contains the following information:

   ```
   % mkdir -p /home/buildmaster/UBOS-STAFF-DEPOT/shepherd/ssh
   % ssh-keygen
   ```

   Specify ``/home/buildmaster/UBOS-STAFF-DEPOT/shepherd/ssh/id_rsa`` as the filename,
   and no password. You could reuse the above keypair, too, if you'd like to, but the
   ``id_rsa.pub`` file needs to be in that directory, so UBOS can configure the
   ``shepherd`` account correctly. (The private key doesn't need to be there.)

1. Boot a UBOS container that will become the local {{% gl Depot %}}. This requires that
   you have a UBOS container tarball available that you have downloaded. Let's assume we use
   ``ubos_dev_container-pc_LATEST.tar``:

   ```
   % sudo machinectl import-tar ubos_dev_container-pc_LATEST.tar depot
   % sudo machinectl start depot
   ```

1. Login as shepherd with the private key of the keypair whose public key ended up
   in the ``UBOS-STAFF`` directory:

   ```
   % ssh shepherd@depot -i /home/buildmaster/UBOS-STAFF-DEPOT/shepherd/ssh/id_rsa
   ```

   and install a locally built ``ubos-depot`` package, unless you want the default from
   the default UBOS depot at ``http://depot.ubos.net/``. You may want a locally built version
   if the container you are booting uses an image you built yourself; otherwise version
   inconsistencies between standard UBOS and your build may occur.

   You can copy the package file from the host to the container with ``scp``, or
   ``machinectl copy-to``. Then, in the container:

   ```
   % sudo pacman -U --noconfirm ...path...to.../ubos-repo...pkg.tar.xz
   ```

1. Set up the depot website:

   ```
   % sudo ubos-admin createsite
   ```

   Enter ``ubos-repo`` as the name of the {{% gl App %}}, ``depot`` as the hostname, and
   paste the content of the host's ``local.ssh/id_rsa.pub`` (that you created earlier) into the
   field where it asks for a public upload ssh key. Pick whatever admin account information,
   it does not matter in this case.

1. You should now be able to reach ``http://depot/`` from the host. (Note: by default, the front
   page redirects to ``http://ubos.net/``) If you cannot reach it, check your container setup.
   On the host, as ``root``:

   ```
   # echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
   # echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
   ```

   and make sure ``/etc/nsswitch.conf`` contains ``mymachines`` in the ``hosts`` section.

### Uploading built packages to the local depot

On your Arch build machine, go back to the ``ubos-buildconfig`` directory. Edit (or create)
the ``local.mk`` file, so it has these lines:

```
UPLOADDEST=ubos-repo@depot:
UPLOADSSHKEY=local.ssh/id_rsa
```

This will instruct make's ``upload`` target to upload packages and images to the host
``depot`` (i.e. the container you created above), using ``ubos-repo`` as the username, and
and the ssh key you created earlier. User ``ubos-repo`` was automatically created when you
installed package ``ubos-repo`` on the ``depot`` container. The upload will be performed
using ``rsync`` over ``ssh``; hence the syntax for ``UPLOADDEST``.
